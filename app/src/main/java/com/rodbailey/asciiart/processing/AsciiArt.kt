     * Converts a grid of grayscale ARGB pixels to ASCII text.
     *
     * For each pixel in the grid:
     * 1. Reads the grayscale intensity (0–255)
     * 2. Maps intensity to a character from a density-sorted character set
     * 3. Builds a string where each character represents the intensity of its corresponding pixel
     *
     * The sorted character set ensures sparse characters (e.g., space) represent dark areas,
     * and dense characters (e.g., #) represent bright areas, creating a visual ASCII representation
     * of the original grayscale image.
     *
     * This used to take the grayscale `Bitmap` and immediately `getPixels` it back into a
     * freshly allocated array — a full-size copy out of a buffer the caller had just copied
     * in. Taking the pixels directly removes both copies, and with nothing else reading the
     * bitmap, ASCII mode no longer needs one at all.
     *
     * Takes the raw pixels rather than a [PixelGrid]: this reads them and returns, retaining
     * nothing, so there is no ownership to protect. That is why [ImageProcessor] can pass its
     * live scratch buffer straight in without freezing it first.
     *
     * @param grayscalePixels Row-major ARGB pixels of a small de-res grid, e.g. 32x18. May be
     *   longer than [GridSize.cellCount] — the callers pass reusable buffers that are only
     *   ever grown — in which case the tail is ignored.
     * @param size Grid dimensions in cells
     * @param out Reusable [StringBuilder] — cleared and refilled each call so its internal
     *   char buffer is never reallocated after the first frame.
     * @return A multi-line ASCII string, one glyph per cell
